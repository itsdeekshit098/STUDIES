 1)string is class that is why s of String is a capital letter 
 2)java implements strings as objects of type String
 2)obj of strings are immutable:(refer program to have clarity on below points)
       1)see if u create a string 
 4)with respect to strings entry are being made in heap memory that is why u can create the strings using ==>string p1="hasni"
                          ==>string p1=new string("hansi")Ë€
 but w.r.t int,float or all primitve dt they are created in stack memory
5)String class is a final class(with no subclasses ) and cant even inherit its feautures as it final class

 1)the whole thing is u cant change values of string objects directly the changed values will or can be assigned to other objects

 2)u will be having a dout how to change value of string directly. it is possible if u use string buffer to initialize value refer to string buffer program for clarity
