why constructor 
    to declare or assign values while creation of object itself instead of creating and assigning each value to each variable explicitly .


Rules for writing constructors are as follows:

The constructor(s) of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.
A constructor in Java can not be abstract, final, static, or Synchronized.
Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access i.e which other class can call the constructor.

what all we can do in constructors:
    1)can deaclare or initialize variable values
    2)can print somthinh
    NOTE:cant do 
        1)cant declare methods in a constructor
