/**
 * EXP:
 The code defines a class named Test with a main method.

Inside the main method, there is a commented line of code: // \u000d System.out.println("Java comment is executed!!");.

The line appears to be a comment, as it starts with //.

However, it also contains a Unicode escape sequence: \u000d.

In Java, Unicode escape sequences allow you to represent Unicode characters using a six-digit hexadecimal representation.

The Unicode character \u000d represents the carriage return (CR) character, which is used to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.

Now, let's see how this code behaves:

During the compilation process, the Java compiler encounters the Unicode escape sequence \u000d within the commented line.

The Java compiler interprets this escape sequence as a new line character, similar to pressing the "Enter" key.

As a result, the line is transformed as if it had a line break before the System.out.println statement, like this:

// \u000d
System.out.println("Java comment is executed!!");


Since the comment marker (//) is before the Unicode escape sequence, it comments out the Unicode escape sequence itself, and the subsequent line of code is no longer a comment.

As a result, the System.out.println statement is not treated as a comment but as an executable line of code.

Therefore, when you run the code, the System.out.println("Java comment is executed!!"); statement is executed, and the message "Java comment is executed!!" is printed to the console.
