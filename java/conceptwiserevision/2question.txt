1)why java uses 2 bytes for character
    java uses Unicode system not ASCII code system.in unicode system char uses 2 bytes so java so java also uses 2 byte for characters.ts value-range lies between '\u0000' (or 0) to '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)    
2)why cant we convert char to string
    bcz string is nonprimitve while char is primitive so typecasting can be done withing primitive data types so that is the reason why u cant do that.
